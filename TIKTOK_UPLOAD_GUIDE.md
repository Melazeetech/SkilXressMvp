6. Fill in title, description, and category
7. Click **"Upload Video"**

**Benefits:**

## Tips

### For TikTok Videos:
- Make sure the video is **public** (not private)
- Use **vertical videos** for best display in the feed
- Keep videos **under 3 minutes** for best engagement

### For Other Videos:
- Use **direct video file URLs** ending in `.mp4`, `.webm`, etc.
- Make sure the URL is **publicly accessible**
- Test the URL in a browser first to confirm it loads

## Troubleshooting

### "Video doesn't load"
- Check if the TikTok video is public
- Try copying the link again
- Make sure you copied the full URL

### "Auto-fill doesn't work"
- That's OK! Just type your title manually
- Auto-fill is a bonus feature, not required

### "Video shows blank in feed"
- The TikTok link might be invalid
- Try using a different TikTok video
- Contact support if issue persists
